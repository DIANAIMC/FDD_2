# Bookshelf parser

-------

* **Task 1**: Generate a script that extracts every bookshelf URL from the [Project
Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/) web page,
and stores them in a file.

* **Task 2**: Generate a script that iteratively asks the user to provide a bookshelf id to download. If the id
exists within the bookshelf files: Print success and exit. If the id does not exist: Print a message
reporting that to the user and display all the available URLs.
